Elevator Pitch:

Here's the idea: an app that lets users create music by letting them experiment with different instruments coming together, either by writing out the different parts or layering together recordings of their ideas. They can then upload finished songs for the community to listen to. They can also follow their friends and their favorite creators to get news about their latest uploads.
