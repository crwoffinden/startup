# startup
This is my startup repository. 
This is where you will see the work for my startup project and my early coding projects.

My name is Cameron Woffinden. I'm a student at BYU from Holly Springs, NC.

My name is Cameron Woffinden. I served my mission in Pocatello, Idaho.

Through this first assignment I've learned the basics of GitHub, commits, pushing and pulling, and merging commits in both VS Code and GitHub.

Elevator Pitch:

Here's the idea: an app that lets users create music by letting them experiment with different instruments coming together, either by writing out the different parts or layering together recordings of their ideas. They can then upload finished songs for the community to listen to. They can also follow their friends and their favorite creators to get news about their latest uploads.

Simon-html notes:
One thing I learned through this experience was how specific you need to be with html. If you want a new line, row, element, etc., it will not give you one until you specify the old one has ended and then create a new one. I also learned the importance of including text inside the html paragraph, hypertext, etc. Several times the link to my GitHub wasn't showing up because I forgot to include the word GitHub in the anchor, something that could be easily overlooked but key to what you want to do.
