This is my startup repository. 
This is where you will see the work for my startup project and my early coding projects.

My name is Cameron Woffinden. I'm a student at BYU from Holly Springs, NC.

My name is Cameron Woffinden. I served my mission in Pocatello, Idaho.

Through this first assignment I've learned the basics of GitHub, commits, pushing and pulling, and merging commits in both VS Code and GitHub.

Elevator Pitch:

Here's the idea: an app that lets users create music by letting them experiment with different instruments coming together, either by writing out the different parts or layering together recordings of their ideas. They can then upload finished songs for the community to listen to. They can also follow their friends and their favorite creators to get news about their latest uploads.

Simon-html notes:
One thing I learned through this experience was how specific you need to be with html. If you want a new line, row, element, etc., it will not give you one until you specify the old one has ended and then create a new one. I also learned the importance of including text inside the html paragraph, hypertext, etc. Several times the link to my GitHub wasn't showing up because I forgot to include the word GitHub in the anchor, something that could be easily overlooked but key to what you want to do.

For html: This is a style element that you should always include at the top of html files.
<meta
  name="viewport"
  content=
    "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
/>

simon-css: Working with the css provided for simon has taught me a little bit more about what css will give you. Some of these elements included things like how stating the flex arrangement determines if elements will be arranged horizontally or vertically, as well as experimenting with different sizings and positionings. One trait that I also noticed was then when assigning classes to html elements, it gives you the freedom to make up labels based on what you want certain things to do, which can be helpful when you want different structural elements having a similar style. This flexibility isn't always desirable, though, as it can make it frustrating to decide how to accomplish your design.

Notes: 2/24
One thing I noticed is creating html for a design is a lot easier than creating css from scratch. With html, you know what you want the structure to look like, and can make the basic parts pretty easily. With css, you could cycle through several different options before deciding on a design you like, and it takes even more time to try and implement it in a way that fits your vision.
